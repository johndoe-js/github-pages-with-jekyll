# Welcome to my hole

Ah, yes, a refrence to the 2002 film, "The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina". If you stick around long enough, you may get to see more, or even better yet, I'll start repeating my jokes.You can see already I have a strong affinity for commas. Something about long sentences just really butters my eggrolls. 
On this webpage but I'm gonna have some informational content on a variety of topics, especially the ones I have to research for school anyway. Additionally, you can look forward to writings about groovy beats, disney history, and the rants of a madman.
