Captain's Log: 16-04-2020 0:29

It's been quite a day, one of learning and lack of work in humanities classes, which is something I can get behind. I further
explored the terrains of codecademy which has become a familiar domain to me but I venture to the new land of "GitHub". I heard
of it from one of the elders in my class, a demigod named "Issac" that humbled bragged about learning html. In my hubris, a key
quality of a good programmer, I sought out superiority so I have dedicated my time to make a better website. Of course you need
meaningful content on a good website so in place of that, I am making this. So far I have done quite a few tutorials just 
figuring out how to use this server with its collaborative aspects. Collaboration is hard when you don't like talking to people 
but I'm sure I'll find it useful later, hopefully with my study. As far as that goes, I intend to focus on incorperating 
sensors into the prosthetic, kind of like the hand from the tomato test paper. To do so, I need to figure out what kind of 
sensors I will be using. Currently, some product arduino seems like a good idea but then the issue of materials to make the 
prosthetic and what machinery will be used to operate it come up and complicate things. I believe a mentor can help with all 
this but that requires doing something other than spending an unhealthy amount of time on these tutorials and such. None the 
less, I will persist.
